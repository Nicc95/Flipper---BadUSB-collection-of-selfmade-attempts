Attempt at making a notepad outputting BadUSB Script for Flipper Zero.
Current status is buggy to say the least, it opens Notepad and outputs lines but when i run it locally on my own system it comes out in fractions of the intended test.
Will update Readme as the project itself progresses, but endgoal is to have a .txt file that you simply load into your Flipper Zero and then outputs the message.
Will also be easily editeable message, and also easily extended as you just copy previous lines as needed.

But alas it is currently broken, if you want to try it out and find it to work on your system or find a fix for the problem before i do please do let me know and i will credit you fully.

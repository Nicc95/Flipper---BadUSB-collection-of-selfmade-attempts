Collection of selfmade payloads for the Flipper Zero BadUSB mode.
Drawn inspiration from a few other projects but none of them did what i wanted/needed, so made my own attempts.

All payloads are just load into the Flipper Zero's BadUSB folder from qFlipper, then run on target systems.
They should be somewhat adapted to run on slower systems for the most part, but the Notepad prank one for some reason is running very slow/laggy.
If you have any tips or pointers regarding any of my projects do let me know, i am working at learning this properly.

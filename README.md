Collection of selfmade payloads for the Flipper Zero BadUSB mode.
Drawn inspiration from a few other projects but none of them did what i wanted/needed, so made my own attempts.
All of them should be fairly easy to edit whatever you want to change in them, just look for links in the web one if you want them sent somewhere else or change the text in the cmd one to the message you want put across.

All of them are currently to be seen as works in progress, i have gotten them to work on my system but when testing it on some friends som work and some dont with no continuity in who works where.
Will keep working on them, and most recent and stable version will always be up in this repository.

All payloads are just load into the Flipper Zero's BadUSB folder from qFlipper, then run on target systems.
They should be somewhat adapted to run on slower systems for the most part, but the Notepad prank one for some reason is running very slow/laggy.
If you have any tips or pointers regarding any of my projects do let me know, i am working at learning this properly.
